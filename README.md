# IoT for Electronics Mobile Application

## Overview
IBM IoT for Electronics is an integrated end-to-end solution (made of multiple services and applications) that enables your apps to communicate with, control, analyze, and update connected electronics.  

The IoT for Electronics Mobile App is a sample source code for interacting with the IBM IoT for Electronics solution. The app enables you to use your mobile device to view the status of and send commands to the simulated appliances that you created in the IoT for Electronics Starter app.

This sample source code for IoT for Electronics is intended solely for use with an Apple iOS product and intended to be used in conjunction with officially licensed Apple development tools and further customised and distributed under the terms and conditions of your licensed Apple iOS Developer Program or your licensed Apple iOS Enterprise Program. 

## Prerequisites
Required:
- An [IBM Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/). A 30 day trial account is free.
- The [IoT for Electronics Starter app](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/iot-for-electronics-starter/) registered in Bluemix.
- Simulated appliances created in the Starter app (using instructions found in the Starter app).
- Apple XCode 7.2.1 or higher integrated development environment.
- An IOS 9.0+ iPhone mobile device: 4s, 5, 5c, 5s, SE, 6, 6s, 6 plus or 6s plus.

## Try it
To try the mobile app, you need to perform the following tasks:

1. Download the [source code from the master branch](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iote-mobile/archive/master.zip) for the mobile app, onto a computer on which Xcode 7.2.1 or above is installed.
2. Connect your iPhone to a computer on which Xcode installed.
2. Double click on the `IoT-Electronics-mobileApp-SWIFT.xcworkspace` file to open the project in Xcode.
3. Select your device as a build destination.
4. Launch the application on your iPhone device from Xcode. Follow the [Apple developer instructions for running Apps on devices from Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/LaunchingYourApponDevices/LaunchingYourApponDevices.html) 

### Getting started with the mobile app
1. On your iPhone, start the IBM IoT for Electronics mobile app.
2. Scroll through the walkthrough, and then click **Try It Out**.
3. When prompted, scan the QR code to connect the mobile app to your **IoT for Electronics** organization in Bluemix.  
4. Register your simulated appliances in the mobile app using the supplied QR codes.
